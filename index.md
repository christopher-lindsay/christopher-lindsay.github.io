# About Me

I am a third year PhD candidate and Gruber Science Fellow at the Yale Astronomy department working with Sarbani Basu. I received my M.S. and M.Phil from the Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences in 2022. I graduated in 2020 from the University of Southern California with degrees in Astronomy, Environmental Studies, and Jazz Studies. 

Currently, I am primarily interested in using asteroseismology to study interior mixing and angular momentum transport processes in evolved low mass stars. Understanding what is going on inside stars requires a combination of data analysis and stellar modeling techniques. See my [Research]({{% link research/ %}}) section for more information. 
During my undergrad, I was an observer for the Mount Wilson node of the Birmingham Solar Oscillations Network and studied high angular degree solar oscillations with data from the Solar Dynamics Observatory. 

I was raised on the island of Oahu in Hawai'i, which, due to my proximity to the University of Hawai'i’s Institute for Astronomy, spurred my interest in Astronomy from a young age. I’ve taken multiple trips to Mauna Kea, including for a recent observing run with Keck (see [my photos]({{% link ./pictures/ %}})). 

Take a look at my [Outreach and Media]({{% link ./outreach/ %}}).
