### Red Giant Seismology

Asteroseismology is the study of oscillations in stars. So called ‘Solar-type’ oscillators have modes in two major categories, p-modes where the restoring force is pressure, and g-modes, where the restoring force is gravity (or rather buoyancy). In this work we focused on red giant stars where p-modes oscillate in the outer convective envelope and g-modes oscillate in the radiative core. The two propagation regions are separated by a thin ‘forbidden’ region across which modes can couple, giving rise to mixed modes of g-like character in the core and p-like character in the outer envelope. 
Since the coupling of core g-modes and envelope p-modes depends strongly on the details of the stellar interior structure near the convective boundary, observed dipolar mixed modes can be exploited to answer questions related to core/envelope mixing processes such as convective overshooting. Convective overshoot is the process by which convective fluid parcels overshoot their classical convective boundaries, powered by their own momentum. This leads to efficient extra mixing beyond the classical convective boundaries, effectively changing the convection zone size. 
Using stellar model calculations, we showed in a recent paper (Lindsay et al., 2022) that changing how overshooting from red giant convective envelopes is modeled makes a significant difference in the asteroseismic properties of stars near the red giant branch luminosity bump. We will use these theoretical findings to guide additional research projects.

### Sub-giant Asteroseismology

I am interested in using data from space based photometry missions (Kepler and TESS) to study the oscillation properties of sub-giant stars. Since stellar oscillations are connected to the stellar interior structure, studying these stellar oscillations will lead to a better understanding of low mass star evolution through improved measurements of the sizes of convective stellar cores. 

### Cluster Red Giants
I am currently using various ‘peak-bagging’ codes in the literature and under current development to study the oscillation modes of red giant stars in the Kepler clusters: NGC6791 and NGC6819.
